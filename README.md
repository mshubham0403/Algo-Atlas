# TSP Visualizer

An application that visualizes various algorithms utilized to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem on an interactive world map, featuring real cities. Implemented algorithms such as Nearest Neighbor, Convex Hull, and Nearest Insertion, highlighting their step-by-step execution and providing insightful visual representations of optimal routes, showing how different approaches lead to apparently similar, but still wildly varying results.
