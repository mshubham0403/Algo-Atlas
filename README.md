# TSP Visualizer

Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? This is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) that this projects tackles. In doing so, several greedy algorithms have been implemented and animated from scratch, showing how different approaches lead to apparently similar, but still wildly varying results. 


### Tech stack

I used React with Chakra UI for the interface and deck.gl for the map. The algorithms themselves are written in plain JavaScript.

### Run locally

If you want to play around with the project locally, cloning it + `npm install` + `npm start` should suffice.
